## Instructions

After installing dependencies, run `npm run start` to see the project.
</br>
Once the project is running, in the browser, you will see a list of words being loaded immediately. From there, you can click "add a word" to be directed to a page that allows you to do just that. You are then able to type a word into the field and either click "add" or press enter to add your word to the list. There, you will see a loading indicator showing that your word is being added to the list. You may notice some form validation, as well.
</br>
After you have added a word or multiple words, you can click "view list" to check up on your growing list of words. Feel free to add as many words as you desire!

## Comments

This project was an exciting and eye-opening experience for me. When I first opened up the boilerplate code, I was a little overwhelmed. There were more files than I'd ever seen and I hadn't worked with most of the technologies being used. Thankfully, I knew enough to start reading the docs and eventually got my bearings. Once things started clicking I really enjoyed the structure of coding in this environment. I also started thinking about the only comparable project I've worked on and how I would go about refactoring it.

Anyway, I'm sure I made a number of mistakes and I definitely have some questions but I am very excited to continue working with these technologies!
